# Other Card Packs
You can make your own card packs! It's really simple.

Simply specify your black and white cards in the format below. Blanks should be one underscore. Multiple blanks will
make multiple-draw questions.

Specify black cards with three underscores "BLACK" and three more underscores (```___BLACK___```). The same goes for
white cards (```___WHITE___```).

Please do not put periods at the end of your white cards.

Submit a pull request if you would like, and I will include your pack in the official IRC channel.

```
___BLACK___
Everything was going great until _ happened.
I _, I _, I _.
Who am I? _
___WHITE___
Dinosaurs
Black Jesus
Came
Saw
Conquered
```
